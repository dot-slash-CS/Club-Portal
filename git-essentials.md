# Git/Github Essentials

A few things/commands we need for webdev.

Git is a version tracking software to organize our code and track versions. It makes it
easier to roll back errors. It is client/server software that together keep track of all your files
and manage the code base. git you installed on your computer can be called client.

Github is a website that keeps the remotely available server that all clients can acccess to. To download files from the server you don't need to register. But to upload files you do need to register.
It is free to register and to publish any project on github.

First downloading project:
https://github.com/dot-slash-CS/Club-Portal

We can clone the whole project with a simple line (no need to register)
git clone https://github.com/dot-slash-CS/Club-Portal

We have not decided on which github repository to use.
For now we will be using this:
https://github.com/taro220/Node-express-ejs-template
